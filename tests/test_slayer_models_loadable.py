"""Verify the exported per-DB SLayer YAML trees load cleanly.

W6 gate: every ``slayer_models/<db>/`` directory must round-trip through
``YAMLStorage`` — datasource present + at least one model that
Pydantic-validates against the current ``SlayerModel`` schema. Catches
any malformed YAML produced by the export pipeline before we point a
benchmark run at it.

This test is parametrized over the 27 mini-interact DBs we ship.
Discovers them at collection time so adding a new DB folder makes the
suite pick it up automatically (and removing one shrinks the gate).
