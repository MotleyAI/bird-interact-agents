"""W6 wiring tests: ``resolve_task_storage_dir`` against the real
per-DB YAML trees in ``slayer_models/``.

Exercises the full preprocessor + resolver path end-to-end with a real
task shape so we know the harness will hand the agent a YAMLStorage
that actually has the deletion applied.

Relies on the canonical ``slayer_models/households/`` tree shipped in
this repo. ``households_1`` from ``mini_interact.jsonl`` deletes KB 15
(``properties.bathroom_ratio``); we use the same KB id here so the
test mirrors the real benchmark contract.
